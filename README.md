## Why Wenyi

| Typical approach | Wenyi |
|---|---|
| Segments translated in isolation, unaware of surrounding content | Whole-book prescan with chapter digests and rolling context |
| Glossary managed manually or as an afterthought | Real-time term extraction with conflict detection, fed back into subsequent batches |
| Single-pass translation, fragile to interruptions | Batch checkpoints and chapter status tracking: resume any interrupted run with the same command |
| Raw model output, no systematic quality process | Translate → polish → evidence-driven whole-book review |

Wenyi is designed for **long-form texts** — novels, social-science monographs, narrative nonfiction, and more.

## Core features

- **Web workspace** — English and Chinese interfaces, live translation progress, paragraph proofreading with revision history, and whole-book review with evidence and publication results.
- **Whole-book understanding** — prescans the source before translation, creating per-chapter digests and a book-level synopsis injected into every batch
- **Real-time glossary** — extracts proper names, terms, and recurring expressions as translation progresses; detects conflicting translations and surfaces them for resolution
- **Multi-stage quality** — optional polishing (strong model) and an evidence-driven whole-book AI review
- **Resumability** — batch-level checkpoints, chapter status tracking, and atomic state writes; interrupt at any point and resume with the same command
- **Multiple LLM providers** — DeepSeek, OpenAI, OpenRouter, OrcaRouter, Google Gemini, Ollama, vLLM, and generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints; keep three convenient tiers or select models per operation, mix connections, and share request limits. See [model routing](docs/configuration.md#models-and-operation-routing).
- **Native EPUB preservation** — writes translated text back into the original XHTML templates and attempts to preserve styles, images, TOC, and anchors
- **Bilingual output** — optional source-and-translation edition with visually subdued source text, including dark mode support

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

Wenyi requires Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigDawnGhost/wenyi.git
cd wenyi
uv sync
```

### Configuration

Set your API key:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### One-command translation

```bash
uv run wenyi translate book.epub
```

This parses the book, detects the source language, prescans for understanding, translates all chapters, and assembles the output. The monolingual Chinese EPUB is written to `output/book.zh.epub` by default.

Multilingual translation (experimental): select a direction using `language.source` / `language.target`, such as `zh → en` or `en → ja`. Run `uv run wenyi languages` for the list. Targets have separate state and output names. See the [usage guide](docs/usage.md#multilingual-translation-experimental).

### Step-by-step workflow

```bash
# 1. Prepare — parse, analyze, prescan (no body text translated)
uv run wenyi prepare book.epub

# 2. Translate — resume from the prepared state
uv run wenyi translate book.epub

# 3. Review — independent final review against the completed glossary
uv run wenyi review book.epub

# 4. Check progress
uv run wenyi status book.epub
```

### Interrupt and resume

Every completed batch is persisted immediately. If a run is interrupted, execute the same command again:

```bash
uv run wenyi translate book.epub
```

### Command-line overrides

```bash
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --polish --review          # enable polishing and final review
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --no-polish                # disable polishing
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --no-review                # skip final review
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --bilingual                # produce both editions
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --chapter 0                # translate the first chapter (indices start at 0)
uv run wenyi translate book.epub --format txt               # export as plain text
```

Final review runs by default after the complete book has been translated and the
glossary has reached its final state. Pass `--no-review` or set
`pipeline.review: false` to skip it. You can also run Agent Review independently:

```bash
uv run wenyi review book.epub
uv run wenyi review book.epub --autofix
```

Each Review run starts from the beginning, checks chunks concurrently, and can
selectively request cross-book evidence before resolving contradictory
consistency suggestions. Confirmed issues can produce provisional full-segment
replacements in a run-local shadow translation. A fresh whole-book review sees
the shadow text—but not the previous issue explanation—and validates it again.
Review publishes to formal chapter `target` values by default. Pass
`--no-autofix` or set `pipeline.review_autofix: false` to keep the run
read-only. With Autofix, folded changes are applied first and remaining
issues reuse the existing Review Agent Loop and Fixer against that updated text.
Only formal segment `target` values are replaced; full history stays in the Review
directory's `autofix/index.json`. The consolidated result, run usage, events, and
internal records are written under `state/<book>/targets/<target-language>/reviews/review-<timestamp>/`.

## Windows launcher (this fork)

This fork ships a small Windows wrapper next to the CLI, so the usual options do not have to
be typed by hand. It lives in [`scripts/windows/`](scripts/windows/README.md):

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wenyi-gui.cmd` | GUI: pick a document, preview the command, start the run |
| `translate-doc.cmd` | CLI wrapper: translate, or re-export from existing state (`-Assemble`) |
| `epub-compat.cmd` | Rewrite an exported EPUB for readers with weak MathML support (NeatReader and friends) |

What it adds on top of the CLI:

- The GUI defaults to target `zh`, the **BabelDOC** PDF backend, and **writing a compatible EPUB
  copy** with formula mode `hybrid`: formulas become real Unicode text where possible, and 2D
  structures (fractions, matrices, sums with limits) are rendered to PNG with MiKTeX.
- `epub-compat.py` also normalises the OPF metadata, adds a cover, and gives every copy a fresh
  `urn:uuid`, so a reader treats it as a new book instead of reusing a half-imported one.
- Formula rendering degrades to plain Unicode text whenever MiKTeX is missing, and images are
  deduplicated and cached, so re-runs are instant.
- API keys stay in the environment. `config.yaml` only references them by name (`api_key_env`),
  and nothing under `state*/`, `babeldoc-sessions/`, `output/` or the launcher's settings file is
  tracked by git.

Options and troubleshooting are documented in [`scripts/windows/README.md`](scripts/windows/README.md).
These scripts are Windows conveniences layered on top of wenyi; they do not change the core packages.

## Supported formats

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| EPUB, FB2, TXT, Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX | EPUB (monolingual / bilingual), TXT, HTML, Markdown, DOCX |
| SRT (movie / series subtitles) | `.zh.srt` (monolingual) and optional `.zh-bi.srt` (bilingual) |

- PDF input defaults to MinerU and requires `MINERU_API_KEY` for the initial conversion; the resulting HTML is cached and reused. The BabelDOC bridge is optional for layout-preserving PDFs.
- EPUB output attempts to preserve the original book's styles, images, table of contents, and anchors. Vertical layout is converted to horizontal for Chinese reading.
- Source language is auto-detected by default, or fixed to an ISO 639-1 code in `config.yaml`.
- `.srt` input is auto-detected by `translate`. It uses a light concurrent path (no glossary, polish, or whole-book review). State lives under `state/srt/<slug>/targets/<target-language>/`; outputs default to the source file's `output/` directory. Details: [Usage guide](docs/usage.md#srt-subtitles).
- `.docx` input uses the full book pipeline. Headings, simple tables, lists, and common run/paragraph styles are preserved where possible; translated Chinese uses Song (宋体). Default export is `.zh.docx` (override with `--format`). Details: [Usage guide](docs/usage.md#docx-word).

## Translation pipeline

Wenyi combines whole-book understanding, batch translation, optional polishing, review, and export. See the [translation pipeline](docs/pipeline.md) for the flowchart and stage details.

---

## Documentation

- [Usage guide](docs/usage.md) — installation, Windows setup, input/output, resumability, independent stages
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) — providers, languages, pipeline switches, segmentation, paths
- [Translation pipeline](docs/pipeline.md) — whole-book analysis, terminology, context, polishing, review
- [Web deployment](docs/web.md) — Docker/local Web stack, workers, exports, and project workflows
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) — development, testing, and contribution guidelines

Translated state directories for public-domain books may be shared through [wenyi-bookcase](https://github.com/BigDawnGhost/wenyi-bookcase). Do not publish copyrighted text, private books, or `state/` directories containing sensitive information without permission.

---

## Limitations

- Multilingual translation is experimental: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Vietnamese, and selected variants have built-in profiles. Real-model long-form quality still needs evaluation; the CLI and prompt instructions use English, while generated descriptive metadata follows the translation target.
- Polishing and final review are the most expensive stages. Shadow fixing may
  trigger multiple full-book review passes and additional Fixer calls.
- PDF input defaults to MinerU and requires an API key for the initial conversion. The BabelDOC bridge is optional for layout-preserving PDFs.
- SRT translation is a light concurrent path: no glossary, polishing, or whole-book review, and slug collision is possible for identically named files in different folders.
- Translation quality is bounded by the capabilities of the chosen LLM model.
- Very long books may produce large state directories; storage requirements grow with book length.
